            <h1>Learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages</h1>
            <p>If you want to become a front-end developer, you first need to be able to code professionally with HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript. Front-end coding is easier than other areas of programming, and there are plenty of
                resources on the Internet to speed up the learning process. In addition, for every problem you
                encounter, a solution can be found in the Q&A forums.</p>

            <h3>Getting to know the principles of user experience</h3>
            <p>The front-end developer must know the needs of the users well. He should be able to design the user
                interface of an application in such a way that users get the best experience while using it. In fact,
                the key to the success of a front-end programmer is to know the user and his needs in the first step and
                to be able to design and implement a page based on that need in the next step.</p>

            <h2>What is front end?</h2>
            <h4>Front End is the visible part of a website or software by users. The front end displays incomprehensible
                codes to users in a graphical and visual format so that they can easily use different parts of the site.
                In this section, information input forms, sounds, images, videos and generally anything else that can be
                understood by the user are placed.</h4>
            <img src="img/1.jfif" alt="">
            <p></p>
            <p>Front-end is divided into two main parts of user interface design and development. In the design
                department, designers use graphic software such as Photoshop, Adobe XD, Figma, etc. to design the
                appearance of the site. But the development part of the user interface is related to the implementation
                of the appearance of the site in the form of HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes. The visible part of the
                site for front-end users is called the client side. Therefore, the codes written on the front-end side
                are processed and executed in the user's browser. This means that the user has direct access to these
                codes and can view them. The front-end is directly related to the back-end and has a great impact on the
                user experience when using the product.</p>

            <h2>What are Front end programming languages?</h2>
            <h5>Nowadays, you can code with many programming languages ​​in the field of front-end, but the three
                important and main languages ​​that are mandatory for every front-end programmer are HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript. With the passage of time, each of these three items included different versions in the form
                of new languages. For example, TypeScript was created as an improved version of JavaScript and is used
                when coding with some frameworks such as Angular. In the following, we will review these front-end
                programming languages</h5>

            <h3>An example of a front in the real world</h3>
            <h5>To better understand the concept of front end, consider a movie. The appearance of the site is like a
                movie that you are watching. Actors and filmed scenes are the components that make up the front end, and
                they are placed in their desired location and act based on the director's instructions. Director
                commands are the same HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes that create the user interface</h5>
